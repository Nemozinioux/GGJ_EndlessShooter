Hello! This github repository is hosting for my Global Game Jam 2024 submission "UltraDumb", a fast-paced wave shooter with inspirations from Ultrakill. 

The goal is to survive while the weapon's upgrades make it more and more chaotic, and the number of enemies lags the game...

Currently working on implementing mass crowd control to better optimize large amounts of enemies and reduce lag.
